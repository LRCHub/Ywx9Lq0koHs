Out of the day
Into the night
Blinding burn, burning light
Shading my eyes
Into the sun
Hide the red, hide the sun
Driving home

IÂ'll soon be home

Feet are so gold
Reaching gown
Guild the road
Like a crown
Shadowy trees
Breaking the sky
Bind the day to the night
Driving home
IÂ'll soon be home

I will keep the wheels on turning till IÂ'm there
Keep on driving through the sunset coma dare
Till IÂ'm there

Till IÂ'm home
Driving home
I will keep the wheels on turning till IÂ'm there
Keep on driving through the sunset coma dare
Till IÂ'm there

Driving home
IÂ'm almost home

Out of the day
Into the night
Blinding burn, burning light
Shading my eyes
Into the sun
Hide the red, hide the sun
Driving home
IÂ'll soon be home
IÂ'll soon be home
